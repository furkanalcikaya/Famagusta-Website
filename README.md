School term project. Smart City Web App for Famagusta Municipality.

Explaining of how it works our system:

Using the website requires internet access. First, we download the necessary libraries and tools with the 'npm install --yes' command. Once express.js is installed in the Node.js engine, it is run locally from the device with the 'nodemon index.js' command. The site can be used in detail when accessed from port 3000. MongoDB host connection address is required for the DB connection. Itâ€™s just taken a minute copy and paste. After pasting your MongoDB connection address to code, it will automatically activate when you run the code. Our website will be tested in detail before delivery. There is no need to log in or register to use our website.
