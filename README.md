JavaScript Node.js express.js EJS CSS and NoSQL used. For database MongoDB.  
Our application works optimally in Web Kit based browsers. The web page has its best view in 1920*1080 dimensions.

Explaining of how it works our system:

Using the website requires internet access. 

## Installation
First, we download the necessary libraries and tools with the command below:
```bash
npm install --yes
```

Once express.js is installed in the Node.js engine, it is run locally from the device with the 'nodemon index.js' command. The site can be used in detail when accessed from port 3000. MongoDB host connection address is required for the DB connection. It’s just taken a minute copy and paste. After pasting your MongoDB connection address to code, it will automatically activate when you run the code. Our website will be tested in detail before delivery. There is no need to log in or register to use our website.

First need required frameworks download node, express etc. Second, creating MongoDB account and doing connection with our main js codes. Third, we create main website routes, IP and ports. After all these just coding and make UI design. 

## Usage

```bash
node index.js
