Cyprus is the third-largest island in the Mediterranean after Sicily and Sardinia. The name Kypros was first used by the Ionian researcher Homer in history. Etymologically, it is thought that the name Cyprus comes from the Latin word aes Cyprium, which means Cyprus metal or Cyprus copper.

The histories of the cities of Cyprus go back to very ancient times. In addition to cities like Salamis, Curium, Amathus, and Lapithos, whose only traces remain after being destroyed by earthquakes or invasions, there are cities that have continued to exist, sometimes experiencing bright days and sometimes losing their importance.

It is estimated that human settlement in Cyprus dates back to around 10,000 BC. Archaeological excavations in the south of the island have revealed that the first human settlers left some structures around 9000 BC and settled here during the Neolithic period.

Around 3000 BC, the copper mines on the island began to be processed by people and used in tool making, attracting people from Egypt, Syria, Palestine, and Mesopotamia to the island and activating commercial life. Traces of this period's settlements have been seen in Lapta, and the Temple of Pigades, the Tumba Tu Skuru Tombs, the Karmi Bronze Age Cemetery, and the Enkomi Temple are a few of the most important works of this era.

Moreover, the ruins of Enkomi, located northeast of Famagusta, indicate that it was one of the central cities of trade that developed in this age.

Today, Famagusta, which houses one of the strongest ports in the Mediterranean, experienced its main development during the Lusignan period. The city became the second city of the island after Nicosia during the Lusignan Period (1192-1489).

Churches and monasteries brought a life of great gain and luxury to the city of Famagusta, disregarding moral rules, and this condition was frowned upon by some devout Europeans who visited the city on their way to the Holy Lands (Palestine), even once cursed by a Swedish saint who prophesied that the city would be destroyed very soon. This prophecy by St. Bridget would come true shortly; naturally for political and economic reasons. The war between Venice and Genoa, which ended in Genoese supremacy in 1372, accepted that this region would be governed by Genoese Laws until 1469. From this period until the end of the Venetian period, Famagusta had become the capital city. During the Genoese period, the city was used entirely as a military zone, and this was the end of the cosmopolitan merchant class and the vibrant trade.

In the same years, the discovery of sea routes by Western Europe that would allow direct relations with the East would sideline Cyprus in this field. Thus, the city, which carries the Lusignan identity with cathedrals and streets opening into them around small and large squares, had stopped its development and time, wrapping itself in silence.

Until 1489, the Lusignans regained control of the city. During this time, the Venetians took possession of the island, seizing the opportunity of the death of the last Lusignan King James II and the Venetian origin of Queen Catherina. The Venetian rule in Cyprus began on February 16, 1489, when the last Lusignan queen, Caterina Cornaro, surrendered the island to Venetian administration in a ceremony held in St. Nicholas Cathedral. During the Venetian period (1489-1571), the noticeable decline in the island's prosperity also affected Famagusta. The Venetians' view of Cyprus as a military base and their general neglect of the island would lead to Famagusta losing its old importance.

Famagusta had transformed into a fortified port city and military base with reconstructed walls and ditches, an inner castle, and the Sea and Land Gates according to the conditions of the day. Developments during this period were concentrated around the center formed by St. Nicholas Cathedral, the square, and the Venetian Palace. The Venetians strove for a long time to transform Famagusta into a small Venetian city and transferred many features of Venice, Italy, here. The most important of these is the Winged Lion. St. Mark took over as the patron saint of Venice from St. Theodoros, and the Winged Lion, his emblem, later became the official symbol of the Venetian Republic. The Winged Lion of Venice is located at the Sea Gate and at the entrance to Othello Castle. At the same time, the statue of St. Theodoros and the Winged Lion, which stands on two columns in Venice connect the moat to the sea and create a complete Venetian city.

In the classical antiquity, Famagusta was known as "Arsinoe," named in honor of Queen Arsinoe II of Egypt. In Greek, it was known as "Ammochostos," meaning "hidden in the sand." In later periods, the city became known as "Famagusta" in English and "Mağusa" in Turkish. After the Cyprus Peace Operation in 1974, the city was bestowed the title "Gazi," hence Gazimağusa. Famagusta, due to having a church for every day of the year, was also historically known as the "city of 365 churches."

The years between 1291-1300 were the golden age for Famagusta. Commerce has always been a significant financial resource for the economy of Famagusta. The fall of Acre, the last stronghold of Western Christianity in the Middle East in 1291, marked a significant turning point. Following this event, many Frankish nobles and businessmen were allowed to come to Cyprus, settling in Famagusta, making the city a bustling port and trade center. Many valuable commercial goods brought from Eastern countries to the shores of Syria began to be transported Famagusta by local traders, thereby playing a significant role as a transit center and warehouse in East-West trade. Traders belonging to various religious groups exported Cypriot products to Europe or Islamic countries. The exported Cypriot products included a variety of items such as silk, barley, salt, asbestos, and "ambelebulya" pickle. This vibrant commercial activity led to the traders and shipowners of Famagusta becoming immensely wealthy, living in a luxury that astonished foreigners. It was customary for these traders to dedicate a small portion of their commercial gains to build churches, leading to the rapid construction of 365 churches in the city, as written in historical sources. This is why the city was given the title of the "city of 365 churches."

Many churches of different styles that still exist in the city today were commissioned by these traders. Since people's wealth was also measured by the churches they built, the Inner City became known as the "District of Churches." This wealth also influenced the residential spaces of the local population. During the Lusignan period, the palace, cathedral, square, and port area of the city saw significant development.

The presence of churches and monasteries in Famagusta during this period brought about a life of great gain and luxury, disregarding moral rules, which was frowned upon by some devout Europeans visiting the Holy Lands (Palestine). According to legend, for this reason, the city was cursed by a Swedish saint, St. Bridget, who prophesied it would be destroyed very soon. The war between Venice and Genoa, which concluded in 1372 with Genoese supremacy, accepted that this region would be governed by Genoese Laws until 1469. This led to the belief in the fulfillment of the saint's prophecy.

During both the Genoese and Venetian periods, Famagusta became the capital city. In the Genoese period, the city was used entirely as a military zone, ending the cosmopolitan merchant class and vibrant trade. The discovery of sea routes by Western Europe that would allow direct relations with the East was another factor that shook Cyprus commercially.

The city remained under Genoese control until 1469 and then returned to Lusignan rule until February 16, 1489, when the island was handed back to Venetian administration after a ceremony in St. Nicholas Cathedral following the death of the last Lusignan queen, Caterina Cornaro. The Venetian period (1489-1571) saw a noticeable decline in the island's prosperity, affecting Famagusta. The Venetians' view of Cyprus as a military base and their general neglect of the island led to Famagusta losing its former importance.

The Venetians put great effort into transforming Famagusta into a small Venetian city, transferring many characteristics of Venice, Italy, to it. Among these, the Winged Lion was the most important. St. Mark, replacing St. Theodoros as the patron saint of Venice, and the Winged Lion, his symbol, later became the official emblem of the Venetian Republic. The Winged Lion of Venice is located at the Sea Gate and the entrance to Othello Castle. Moreover, the statue of St. Theodoros and the Winged Lion, which stands on two columns in Venice's St. Mark's Square, now stands in one corner of Famagusta Square, with only its columns remaining. There are even sources that claim the Venetians planned to connect the moat to the sea to create a complete Venetian city.

The cessation of trade during the Venetian period and the transformation of the island into a haven for pirates negatively impacted Famagusta. Due to fears of an Ottoman conquest, the Lusignans fortified and thickened the walls, while the Mantinengo Bastion and the Land Gate were built facing the sea during this time. Additionally, to prevent and repel possible Ottoman attacks and strengthen the city's defenses, a ditch 46 meters long was dug outside the walls and filled with water. Despite all these efforts, the city was conquered by the Ottoman army under Lala Mustafa Pasha after a long siege on August 1, 1571.

During the Ottoman period, the mansions and palaces of wealthy traders and nobles were demolished, and the commercial and economic activities of Cyprus shifted to Larnaca. The formation of the first settlements in the Maraş and Lower Maraş areas dates back to this period. The city became more of a place of exile for significant political prisoners. Namık Kemal, Suphi Ezel, and Kutup Osman are just a few of those exiled. With the social and cultural changes, the architectural and physical environment also underwent transformations. Existing buildings were modified to suit the socio-economic and cultural lives of the new users; cathedrals were converted into mosques with the addition of minarets, and bedestens and arastas were developed, with madrasahs, baths, and fountains constructed to meet basic daily needs. Today, the traces of the Ottoman Period can be seen especially along the section of the wall extending from Canbulat Tomb towards the land. In the Inner City, the population has concentrated towards the southern section, enriching the texture with dead-end streets, an extension of the Ottoman culture and lifestyle.

With the leasing of the island to the British in 1878, Famagusta's port gained importance. Many people worked as laborers in the port and its associated warehouses. During this period, Greeks and Turks lived in different areas, with Turks generally residing in the Inner City, and Greeks settling in the Maraş and Lower Maraş areas. Reflecting the colonial mentality, the British administration established an administrative center containing administrative and some commercial functions as an alternative to the traditional center in the Inner City, located between the areas where Turks and Greeks lived. As a result, the growth and development of the city intensified towards the Maraş area, where the Greeks, who controlled the basic economic activities, resided. Towards the end of the British period, new development areas containing housing, commercial, touristic, and recreational spaces began to form in response to the changing needs of the city's residents and socio-economic changes and developments. This period saw a transformation in the city's identity bearing colonial traces. The influences of British architecture, particularly in form, detail, and material use, are evident. The British, adopting an approach to getting closer to the community under their administration by using local materials and details, have transferred these characteristics to the city of Famagusta.

After the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus in 1960, the Inner City was managed by the Turkish municipality, while other areas were governed by the Greek municipality. During this period, the city developed intensively towards the southeast of Lower Maraş as a tourism center. Especially between 1969-1970, with Beirut losing its significance due to the ongoing war, the Maraş area developed into one of the world's most famous entertainment and tourism centers.

1974 marks a significant turning point for Famagusta, as it does for all of Cyprus. Before this date, the city, with a population of 41,000 and the island's largest port, was a major center for trade and tourism. Between 1974-1986, the city underwent restructuring processes such as the resettlement of immigrants from the south and Turkey, the reorganization of existing areas, and the creation of new residential areas. With the closure of Maraş, the city's most dynamic region, to settlement, the development of the city significantly halted.

The establishment of the Eastern Mediterranean University in 1986 brought about a major change in the socio-economic structure of the city, adding a new population of university students and staff. This change reversed the pre-1974 southward development, now directing it towards the north-northeast. Especially dense construction has emerged in the Sakarya, Karakol, Baykal, north of Salamis Road, and the Tuzla area.

According to the State Planning Organization's 2020 projection, the city's population has reached 55,868. Today, Gazimağusta, besides being a historic city and port city, is also a university town. The current position of Gazimağusta is a continuation of its historical mission under present conditions. Hosting the TRNC's largest port and the only free port, Gazimağusta is not only economically significant but also vital in communication, science, technology, culture, education, and entertainment.
